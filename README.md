# OAP-Taskr
Iqrah, Sulayman &amp; Tom's DurHack project!

## Preface

A series of endpoints designed to network a multitude of technologies to help accessability to help in the community. By talking to the google assistant, someone who is less able to do tasks will be able to get the help they need through a natural language interface. These tasks will then appear on a web based dashboard. Members of the community will be able to assign themselves a task and fulfill it before a deadline. They will earn points to guage thier reliablity and will be sent further details of the task via SMS message to avoid sensitve data being unnessecarily exposed.
